# language-courses
PHP MVC application showing a list of language courses and the comments to each course.<br/>

We can add or edit a comment for a course.</br>
I used bootstrap for the styling.
There is a little javaScript for checking form field.</br>
Note: In real word Project, the user must have the right to modify a comment.
